##Time Lapse Robot
##### Created for a Helsinki University robotics programming course in December 2014.

The idea was to build a Lego Mindstorm robot that would record moving [time lapse videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scxs7L0vhZ4 "Example of time lapse video"). The robot would be controlled by an Android application, through which the user could set the camera movement path, the speed of the movement and the frequency of the images taken. The speed of the movement and the image frequency affects the resulting time lapse video. It should be noted that in this context "movement" is really just camera panning.
